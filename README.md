# homework1
In this homework assignment I was a bit confused by the wording of some of the instructions.
I did my best to demonstrate that I could navigate VS Code and inspect the html files element, tag and styling.
A few of the first changes I made to get use to it were the colors. They helped identify placement of certain elements.
Then I searched for a reference to the main picture by the pixel designation - basically find something on the html that was very big. I found it and resized.
Next I played around with all of the colors for a more noticeable change in appearance.
One of the trickiest parts for me was the "ul" elements. I wanted to changed their block appearance to inline and move the information to the top as a quick reference guide for the user.
Using the position and float properties helped, but still very difficult to grasp right now.
Also, I added a bootstrapcdn file to add a "Contact Support" button.
Lastly, for flare and bonus I added a countdown to the start of Saturday's morning class when homework is due. :)
